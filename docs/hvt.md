# Hirevibe Tokens (HVT)
There will be a <u>350 million</u> total fixed supply of HVT, No more HVT will ever be created.

## HVT will be distributed as Follows:

1. <b>Free Airdrop:</b> 250 million HVT (71.43%) to be Airdropped to all EOS Token Holders within 90 days of the EOS blockchain launch.
2. <b>HV Launch Team:</b> 50 million HVT (14.285%) to be distributed to the HireVibes Launch Team.
3. <b>HV Treasury Fund:</b> 50 million HVT (14.285%) to be held in a HireVibes DAC Treasury smart contract. The HireVibes community can propose and vote on the strategic usage of these tokens.

## HireVibes Launch Team Vesting schedule:
* The HV Launch team will receive 40% of their individual stakes upon the HireVibes Dapp launching.
* Each individual team member will receive 20% every 6 months after HireVibes Dapp launch.
* This means the Launch team wonâ€™t receive all their tokens until after 18 months.

## HireVibes Surplus Tokens:
HireVibes Dapp will receive a small portion of HVT upon every job fill it facilitates (2.5% of the rate / salary in question). So what will happen to these surplus tokens that get generated from using the HireVibes Dapp?

* 50% of all surplus tokens generated will go straight to HVT token holders every 90 days
* 50% of all surplus tokens will go to a Community Vote.

The HireVibes DAC (decentralised autonomous community) can vote to:

* Support, grow or create: Humanitarian and environmental initiatives.
* Grow the HireVibes eco-system and make improvements and to the Jobs Dapp.
* Create educational programmes.
* Purchase property for the benefit of HV eco-system.
* Anything else the community votes (This includes the option of additional distribution of surplus tokens back to the HVT token holders).

The vote will be based on proportional representation meaning HireVibes will distribute the surplus tokens according to the votes cast by the HVT token holders.

We think this is such a cool way for HireVibes to operate as it is you; the HVT token holders (HV DAC) that gets to decide which direction we take the Dapp. The decentralised community will have both a stake and an aligned interest in seeing the HireVibes Dapp succeed.
