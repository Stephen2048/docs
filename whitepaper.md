<b>HireVibes at a high level</b>

HireVibes will provide a "decentralised" community based alternative to the traditional ‘’centralised’’ recruitment agency business model. HireVibes Dapp will transform the hiring and jobs marketplace by:
 
1. Empowering crowdsourcing. HireVibes Dapp will incentivise the public crowd and niche talent communities to become the primary sourcing stream of candidates for job openings globally, which is known as crowdsourcing. When it comes to searching for someone or something, ten sets of eyes have a greater chance of finding that someone or something than any one individual pair of eyes can offer. With potentially thousands and millions of active users operating globally off a Decentralised application; HireVibes can offer a genuine synergy of sourcing ability waiting to be tapped into. 
2. Integrating giving back to the environment and humanitarian projects as a fixed component of each job fill made through the platform.
3. Harnessing the benefits and security of blockchain technology to transparently and efficiently operate a decentralised community-governed application.

<b>HireVibes at a more detailed level</b>
 
HireVibes Dapp will improve the core aspects of the ‘standard economic deal’ when applied to the hiring process: 

* <b>Search:</b> How jobseekers, referrers; start-ups, employers, orgs and DAC's find each other using the power of referrals and aligned incentives via crowdsourcing
* <b>Negotiations:</b> How jobseekers, referrers and start-ups, employers, orgs that use HireVibes Dapp to find a new job or a new hire will get a better deal overall compared to when using traditional centralised recruitment agency services
* <b>Performance:</b> How HireVibes will improve the candidate and hiring manager experience. HireVibes Dapp will become a home for the jobseeker where users can build their own personal data stores and control who has access to this information. 

On the employer side, HireVibes Dapp will be a one-stop hiring shop where a hirer can advertise for free, crowdsource candidates, manage CV applications, communicate in-app and later; hire and pay securely all from one single platform.

* <b>Post-performance incentive:</b> Each new hire will get rewarded with a 5% token reward in HireVibe Tokens (HVT), on top of pay, which contains a fixed 1% Donation Fund to support Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and projects of the new hires’ choice using HireVibe Tokens.

## 2. HireVibes Mission
Humanity’s skills and energy or ‘HR’ could be channelled better to help clean the environment and create abundance for all that live on the planet. HireVibes Dapp aims to redirect the flow of wealth going to centralised agencies into a river of resources for people and the planet using cryptocurrencies, smart contract technology and swarm intelligence methodologies.
## 3. HireVibes Structure and Chosen Blockchain
HireVibes will be an open source crowdsourcing jobs Dapp on the EOS.IO software. HireVibes Dapp will be governed by the HireVibes Decentralised Autonomous Community (DAC) using HireVibe Tokens.
## 4. HireVibes Rewards Model 
HireVibes Dapp will do the core work that a centralised ‘recruitment’ agency or freelance marketplace would normally do: by connecting jobseekers with permanent, contract and freelance job opportunities worldwide based on their desired conditions. 

Upon successful hires, HireVibes Dapp will charge a small token amount of (7.5%) to the hirer / employer based on the salary, rate or total price of the job in question. 

However; following a certain period of time after the new hire begins his/ her job, HireVibes Dapp will automatically redistribute (5%) or (67% of the total 7.5% token amount) back to the successful candidate, broken down as follows;

A) If the user applied directly to the job ad at the beginning of the process:
* (4%) token reward is sent to the placed candidate in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (1%) donation fund is sent to the placed candidate for donating to Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and eco-friendly projects of their choice using (HVT)

B) If the placed candidate was referred to the job ad at the beginning of the process:
* (2%) token reward is sent to the placed candidate in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (2%) token reward is sent to the referrer in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (1%) donation fund is sent to the placed candidate for donating to Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and eco-friendly projects of their choice using (HVT)

## 5. Payment terms based on Job type
HireVibes Dapp will add in a lock-in period to all contracts made between a hirer and a candidate. Meaning; each successful candidate won’t receive their HVT token reward immediately. This reduces the risk of a candidate taking a job just so they can get their HVT and leave.  Escrow services will also be in-built to the HireVibes freelance model.
- Permanent = 30 Days lock-in period 

Meaning when a new hire starts a perm role they found on HireVibes; that user will receive their 5% HVT reward 30 days after start date 
(no payroll option, just a 7.5% token amount)

- Contract = 14 Days lock-in period

Meaning when a new Contractor starts a contract role they found on HireVibes; that user will receive their 5% HVT reward 14 days after start date 
(payroll option and 7.5% token amount)

- Freelance = 7 days lock in period 

Meaning when a Freelancer starts a freelance role they found on HireVibes; that user will receive their 5% HVT reward 7 days after start date 
(payments and 7.5% token amount)

## 6. Value Proposition 

By financially and ethically incentivising the crowd to source candidates (which is a form of ‘crowdsourcing’) with a 5% reward; HireVibes will attract a larger quantity and higher quality of direct and referred CV applications to open job ad’s, making it easier for hirers to consistently make the right hires in an efficient and cost-effective way that generates highly positive PR for their employer brand.

When it comes to sourcing technical IT talent for example; the technical talent themselves are the best people to find other technical talent because they are the domain experts in this field and these people know the job spec and the required profile better than anyone else. So by outsourcing the ‘sourcing’ to the crowd, employers will gain access to a wider network of domain experts to source the talent they are looking for.

Enabling users to earn a cryptocurrency token reward when finding a new job for themselves or their peers, while also making a positive and quantifiable contribution to the environment; both combined, create positive experiences and good vibes for the jobseeker, the hirer and the community at large. 

## 7. Hiring Manager Experience and Benefits
Here are the main advantages of using HireVibes DAC for sourcing and hiring talent:
* <b>Free to advertise job ad’s on HireVibes.io</b> 
This is a risk-free solution as hirers only pay for results i.e. when a hire is made – which is the opposite to paying for a traditional job board listing up front and then ‘praying’ for good suitable applications to arrive.
* <b>Reduced cost</b>
The cost of using HireVibes Dapp is a 7.5% token amount upon successful hires if no add-on service is selected. This is half the cost compared to the 15% industry average fee on permanent jobs, and much less than half of the 25% average fee charged by centralised agencies on contract jobs.
* <b>Public referrals campaign</b>
This creates a new brand engagement stream for the Employer. HireVibes turns the public crowd into brand ambassadors by economically and environmentally incentivising referrals.
* <b>High quality hires</b>
Mean higher quality hires and research shows that referred candidates stay in the job longer on average.
* <b>Positive PR</b> 
The 1% Donation fund (equivalent to 1% of the annual salary / rate in question) creates positive PR and CSR to promote each Employer’s Brand
* <b>Happy and engaged new starters</b> 
By receiving a token reward that includes a donation a certain number of days after start date, the new hire will be happier and more engaged which will massively reduce the risk of the new starter leaving. The token reward will act as a loyalty incentive and will overall produce a happy user experience for the candidate 
* <b>Branded Advertisements</b>
This removes the secrecy around what the ‘client’ is so the employer brand will receive a lot more traffic and exposure to the talent market

## 8. Employer Branding: Merging Hiring and CSR
